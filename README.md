# Jeff Powell Monorepo

This is a monorepo containing Cloudflare workers for Jeff Powell's projects.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workers/             # Cloudflare Workers
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ jeffpowell-dev/  # Personal portfolio website worker
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/         # Source code
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wrangler.jsonc
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm
- Cloudflare account and API token

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:jeffrpowell/jeffpowell.dev.git
cd jeffpowell.dev

# Install all workspace dependencies
pnpm install
```

## üîß Development

### Login workaround

Until https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/10603 and/or https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/5937 are resolved, you have to perform the following workaround to get wrangler to login:

1. `pnpm wrangler login --callback-host 0.0.0.0`
2. Copy-paste the URL
3. Manually change "0.0.0.0" to "localhost"
4. Open your modified link in your browser
5. Click the `Allow` button

### Working with Workers

Each worker has its own Wrangler version. Navigate to the worker directory to use Wrangler commands:

```bash
# Navigate to a worker
cd workers/jeffpowell-dev

# Start local development server
pnpm start

# Run Wrangler commands directly
pnpm wrangler dev
pnpm wrangler tail
pnpm wrangler whoami
# ... any other wrangler command
```

### Debugging

Debugging is configured in a VSCode `launch.json` file for you.

### Building from Root

```bash
# Build all workers
pnpm build

# Build production bundles
pnpm build-prod
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Deploy All Workers
```bash
pnpm deploy
```

### Deploy Specific Worker
```bash
cd workers/jeffpowell-dev
pnpm deploy
```

## üì¶ Adding New Workers

If you need to pull down an existing worker to compare or start with, AND you haven't downloaded it already, use this command:
`pnpm wrangler --cwd workers init --from-dash [name-of-worker]`
It will download to a directory under `/tmp/`, copy the src files, and then error out looking for a `wrangler.toml` file. Go manually hunt for the directory and copy the `wrangler.jsonc` file out of there.

Otherwise, here's the standard recipe for adding a new worker.

1. Create a new directory in `workers/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir workers/my-new-worker
   cd workers/my-new-worker
   ```

2. Initialize with `package.json` and `wrangler.jsonc`

3. The monorepo will automatically include it in workspace commands
