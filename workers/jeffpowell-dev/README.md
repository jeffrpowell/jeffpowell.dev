# Jeff Powell Portfolio

Hi, I'm Jeff Powell. Welcome to my [personal portfolio website](https://jeffpowell.dev)! 

I'm a Software Development Manager at Clearwater Analytics with over a decade of industry experience. My proficiency stretches beyond mere software coding to the elements that surround the development process, including UX design, software and network architecture design, project management, communication, and effective team leadership.

This site showcases my projects, technical skills, and professional journey as a developer, engineer, and creative thinker.

Feel free to reach out for collaboration, consulting, or just to say hi!
